# DBT Project - Star Schema for E-commerce Sales Data

This repository contains a Data Build Tool (DBT) project designed to build a star schema model for an e-commerce sales dataset. The goal of this exercise is to create a star schema by building dimension tables and a fact table to support data analysis and reporting.

## Objective

In this exercise, we will design and implement a Star Schema based on Kimballâ€™s Data Modeling methodology using an Amazon sales dataset. We will create dimension tables, a fact table, and an ERD to support business reporting and analytics needs.

## Exercise Breakdown

1. **Upload the data into BigQuery Table**  
   First, we need to upload the provided e-commerce sales data into BigQuery, which will be used to create the necessary tables.

2. **Build Table dim_fulfilment using DBT**  
   Create a dimension table `dim_fulfilment` to represent fulfillment data, including the fulfillment method and fulfillment partner.

3. **Build Table dim_product using DBT**  
   Create a dimension table `dim_product` containing information about the products such as SKU, style, category, and size.

4. **Build Table dim_promotion using DBT**  
   Create a dimension table `dim_promotion` to store data about promotions related to the sales.

5. **Build Table dim_sales_shipment using DBT**  
   Create a dimension table `dim_sales_shipment` to capture shipping information, including postal codes, city, state, country, and service level.

6. **Build Table dim_sales_channel using DBT**  
   Create a dimension table `dim_sales_channel` to store data about the sales channels through which the products are sold.

7. **Build Table fact_salesorder using DBT**  
   The fact table `fact_salesorder` will be built to aggregate key sales metrics, linking the dimension tables created earlier.

8. **Create an ERD for the Star Schema**  
   Design and document an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the star schema, including all dimension tables and the fact table.

9. **Create an Analysis using Star Schema**  
   Develop an analysis based on the star schema model, such as identifying the top-selling products by category, size, and promotion_id
